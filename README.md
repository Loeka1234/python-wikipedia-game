# Python Wikipedia game

Command-line utility tool for detecting the shortest amount of clicks to go from one Wikipedia page to another.

The program uses web scraping to find all links to other Wikipedia pages. It was a project for school. The algorithm for finding the shortest amount of clicks isn't the best as this was one of my first Python projects.

Recomended version: `Python 3.9.5`

Usage:
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `python main.py`
- For help: `python main.py --help`
